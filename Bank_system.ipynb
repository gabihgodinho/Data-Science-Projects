Version 1 of the project only works with 1 user, so there is no need to worry about identifying which is the branch and bank account number. All deposits must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.\n",

        "#### **Withdrawal operations**\n",
        "####The system must allow 3 daily withdrawals with a maximum limit of R$ 500.00 per withdrawal. If the user does not have a balance in the account, the system must display a message stating that it will not be possible to withdraw the money due to lack of balance. All withdrawals must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.\n",

        "#### **Transaction operations**\n",
