# Gabriela Reis
<sub>*PhD student* at Université de La Réunion and Federal University of Western Pará Center</sub>

As an aspiring Data Scientist and PhD student I combine analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, and attention to details. Having spend the last years applying Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization tecniques to scientific gaps in Brazilian Atmospheric Sciences, I developed a critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

My credentials include a Master's in Envrironmental Sciences from the Post-Graduate Program in Natural Resources of the Amazon (PPGRNA) from the Federal University of Western Pará (UFOPA), an institution of higher education and advanced research whose mission is to produce and socialize knowledge, contributing to citizenship, innovation and development in the Brazilian Amazon.  I also have a degree in Science and Technology and Engineering physics from the same University where I got my Master's degree. Period in which I began to gain experience in data analysis and modeling, with emphasis on environmental data, as well as in the application of geotechnologies and applied mathematics to urban studies.

**Background in:** Python, Geotechnologies, Environmental Sciences and Aplied Mathematics.
